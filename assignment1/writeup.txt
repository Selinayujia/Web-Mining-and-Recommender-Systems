Fit the popularity model, with 71.8% 
If the book is in popular set, predict read
If the book is not in popular set, check the jaccard similarity 
Jaccard similarity is computed by 0.62 * user similarity + 0.38 * item similarity( or just 0.62 * user similarity if item not seen before, same, just 0.38 * item similarity if user not seen before)
If overall similarity more than 8/1000, predict read, else no
